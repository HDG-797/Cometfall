# Cometfall
A sci-fi trilogy exploring the fate of humanity after Earth's downfall... The future utopia turned into the fallen society, the tale of the mankind thereafter, from the human brain to the human mind...

## 📖 About the Story  
In the year **2467**, Earth has fallen.  
Greed and violence have shattered humanity, and the last of our kind now look to the stars for salvation.  
A colossal comet, **Helios**, approaches — a herald of doom, or perhaps redemption.  

As chaos unfolds, **Professor Paddington**, a man torn between science and faith (even though faith in that Era is seen as stupidity), leads a desperate mission to escape Earth before its final collapse.  
But two visionaries (rather physicists), **Harris Gordon** and **Peterson Simmons**, question his path, igniting a division that will define the fate of humankind.  
(We can't give our society's future into the hands of blind faith, and despair)
This is not just a story of survival.  
It’s the story of *faith versus reason*, *hope versus despair*, and *Humanity’s reckoning with itself.*
